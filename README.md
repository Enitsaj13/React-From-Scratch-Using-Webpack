# React-From-Scratch-Using-Webpack
I've made react from scratch using the webpack module bundler instead of CRA or create-react-app. 
I prefer this over CRA because it reduce the file size. From 260+ mb, it became 60+mb. 

Webpack is a very good blunder for react because the production performance is also fast.

Just clone this repository on your project and You can start your react app.
